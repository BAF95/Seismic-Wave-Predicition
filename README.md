# Seismic-Wave-Predicition
Utilizing Machine Learning to predict seismic waveforms from USGS data
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Replicate:

Step 1:
Open Seismic Data.py

Step 2:
On Data_url/line12(reference below),

data_url = "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2020-4-01&endtime=2020-5-01&eventtype=earthquake"

alter starttime= and endtime= towhat ever time period you would like to use the method.
NOTE: Max of 31 day period and minimum of 1

Step 3:
Run Seismic Data.py

Step4:
Run Dataviz1.html to see Waveform Distribution Bar graph

Step5:
Run plotter to see pie and figure plots of various data types
